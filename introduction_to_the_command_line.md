- The CLI
- 'Linux operating system is the most commonly used for servers' Mac OS X and Unix are very similar. Windows is a bit different.
- This book assumes you're using a bash shell. More recent Macs use Zsh. (Bash prompts with a `$`, Zsh with a `%`).
- The prompt. Changes when you are logged in as (all-powerful) root user. Then it is `#`.
- To show whether you're using Bash or Zsh, run `echo $SHELL` and the output will be something like `usr/bin/bash`.
```ruby
echo "Hello World"
# => "Hello World"
```
Why use the CLI?

 - Have power of precision over the computer. (monitor your computer and its resources, diagnose software issues)
